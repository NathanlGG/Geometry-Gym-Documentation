# Licencing

## Evaluation Licence \(Trial\)

The Rhino plug-ins can be evaluated for free for 30 days by following instructions on the previous page. 

{% hint style="warning" %}
The trial period begins on the day of the request. Please ensure you download all plug-ins you think you may want to try prior to requesting the licence.  
{% endhint %}

## Student Licence

We provide the tools to students for free whilst at university. 

## Commercial Licence

The commercial licence of geometry gym developments is accessed through an internet based license server.  This permits the license to float across multiple users and offices \(internationally if desired\). 

More details will be provided upon request.

### Purchasing a Licence

Purchases can be arranged directly with Geometry Gym through email \(after the trial is undertaken\) or we do work with Rhino resellers in various countries.  Refer to the sales page at www.geometrygym.com for more details.

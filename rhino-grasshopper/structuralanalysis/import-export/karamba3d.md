# Karamba3d

## Karamba3d

Karamaba 3d is a structural analysis tool which is embedded within Grasshopper. It provides a way to get feedback on structure at an early design stage without requiring the need to leave grasshopper or interact with external analysis programs \(although the Geometry Gym tools allow this to happen quiet seamlessly\). 

In order to verify or continue to the design Geometry Gym allows for the Import/Export of Karamba3d models to and from external  programs as well as IFC format. 

The below will explain these steps.

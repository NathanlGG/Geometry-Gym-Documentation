# Create with Code

{% hint style="warning" %}
Use with caution when generating models with code. As the code has been generated over a number of years sometimes it is incompatible \(i.e providing different unit outputs\) and not well documented for an end user as this is not the primary use purpose.

In the future we will look to overhaul and improve in-code documentation.

## Introduction

Grasshopper allows for a user to access the geometry gym `.dlls` from within a python or c\# script component. 

Decide whether to include this within each section or provide a separate section as here.

# Rhino Set-up

## Setting up Rhino Toolbars <a id="setting-up-rhino-toolbars"></a>

In the latest version each plug-in installer comes pre-loaded with its own rhino tool bar file and are automatically saved in the Rhino toolbar directory.

If you are using a number of the Geometry Gym plug-ins in Rhino you can create a new toolbar group by using the Tools &gt; Toolbar Layout... from the rhino toolbar.

WIP. Improve above

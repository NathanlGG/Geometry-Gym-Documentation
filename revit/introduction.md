# Introduction

## Introduction

Geometry gyms plug-in for Revit allows for an advance IFC file importer to that of the built-in Revit application. 



## Dynamo

Geometry gym does not currently provide any tools for dynamo. We generally bypass dynamo in a lot of our workflows. If this is something that you would like to see than please do contact us.
